In this case, the JavaFX developers made the standard length of 18 and did not provide an opportunity to change it. Here is their comment:
     
     /*
     * This is rather hacky - but it is a quick workaround to resolve the
     * issue that we don't know maximum width of a disclosure node for a given
     * TreeView. If we don't know the maximum width, we have no way to ensure
     * consistent indentation for a given TreeView.
     *
     * To work around this, we create a single WeakHashMap to store a max
     * disclosureNode width per TreeView. We use WeakHashMap to help prevent
     * any memory leaks.
     *
     * RT-19656 identifies a related issue, which is that we may not provide
     * indentation to any TreeItems because we have not yet encountered a cell
     * which has a disclosureNode. Once we scroll and encounter one, indentation
     * happens in a displeasing way.
